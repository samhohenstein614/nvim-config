# Setup and Requirements

This config requires nvim >= 0.8.0, so build nvim from scratch according to [the official neovim build instructions](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/BUILD.md). Follow the installation instructions for your system.

To install this project on Debian, run the following command: `git clone git@github.com:samhohenstein614/nvim-config.git ~/.config/nvim && nvim`. Then, just run :MasonInstallAll.
